# Universal Scale of Value 💎

An interactive, 3-dimensional holographic visualization exploring the magnitude of wealth. This project puts "billions" and "trillions" into perspective by comparing modern tech giants, historical empires, and national GDPs.

##  The Concept
Inspired by the "Size of Life" by Neal.fun, this project solves the "abstraction problem" of large numbers. Most people cannot visualize the difference between $100 million and $1 trillion. This application uses **Relative Scaling Logic** to render entities next to one another, making the massive scale differences physically visible.

##  Features
* **3D Holographic Engine:** Interactive cards that tilt and react to mouse movement using CSS 3D transforms.
* **Three Data Modes:** * **Tech Giants:** Modern leaders like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA.
  * **Empires:** Historical wealth like Mansa Musa and the Dutch East India Company.
  * **Nations:** Comparing corporate wealth directly to national GDPs.
* **Dynamic Visual Polish:** Background colors and lighting shift to match the branding of the entity in focus.
* **Multi-Currency Support:** Real-time conversion between USD ($), EUR (€), and GBP (£).
* **Scale Anchors:** Integrated non-corporate objects (like the International Space Station) to ground the user in reality.

##  Tech Stack
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Leverages `perspective`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`, and `translateZ` for parallax depth.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** A custom scaling engine that calculates object sizes relative to the current focus point.
* **No Frameworks:** Built for maximum performance and zero dependencies.

##  Methodology
Data is curated for educational orders of magnitude:
* **Tech:** Q1 2025 Market Cap data via Yahoo Finance.
* **History:** Inflation-adjusted estimates (e.g., the VOC value is based on its 1637 peak).
* **Nations:** 2024 GDP projections sourced from World Bank and IMF data.
